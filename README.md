# Oh My Code (OM Code)

OM Code is a GUI for the coding agents on your machine, with web, desktop, and mobile clients. It works with your existing subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity.

## What's different from T3 Code

- **OM Code branding** — name, app icons, favicon, loading splash, and a compact, flat look on web, desktop, and mobile.
- **Project-grouped sidebar** — threads are grouped and nested under their projects, idle projects fold away, project headers show task counts per state, and each header has a new-thread button.
- **Token usage and cost** — per-thread token usage and estimated cost.

Everything else follows upstream.

## Running from source

Install and authenticate at least one provider first:

- Codex: [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), then `codex login`
- Claude: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), then `claude auth login`
- Cursor: [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), then `agent login`
- Grok Build: [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli), then `grok login`
- OpenCode: [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), then `opencode auth login`
- Antigravity: enable it in Settings, then use **Install Antigravity** and **Sign in with Google**

The repo uses [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev/guide/), so install the global `vp` command (`curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash`), then:

```bash
vp i                      # install dependencies
vp run dev                # server + web app
vp run dev:desktop        # desktop app in dev mode
vp run dist:desktop:dmg   # build a macOS desktop app
```
